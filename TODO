* Add '=' to longopts e.g., "hosts="
* Add retries
* Look at os.kill with normal child.pid (no -), *maybe* need -
  - e.g., transients on PlanetLab
* Change output file format
  - Name by IP and port (to handle SSH tunnels, many localhost conns)
* Support an SSH tunnel node
  - Before || ssh, set up tunnels -L .. -L ... -L .. (then use to tunnel)
* Fix up usage
  - Some options have args, some options don't have args (see SHARP svm)
* Fix up timeouts on prsync (doesn't quite work, doesn't look like
  processess are all getting killed, parent/child rsync, ssh?)
